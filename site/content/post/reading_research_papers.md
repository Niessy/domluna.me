Lately, I've read my fair share of research papers. Along the way I've picked up a thing or two about *how* to read them. This is by no means a comprehensive best practice list of sorts; just a few tips I'd like to share that have worked for me. 

1. **Don't treat it like a novel.** You don't have to read this thing front to back. Jump back and forth where it makes sense. I tend to read the abstract and conclusion first, this gives me an idea of what the paper is about and the result of the findings. If this looks good I dig a bit deeper, usually jumping right to the contribution/experiments.

2. **Once you have your feet wet, skip the generic stuff.** You'll notice a decent chunk of any paper is going over the prior art. Often this is the same for many papers, once you know it, feel free to skip it.

3. **You don't need to read them all.** Reading a research paper is hard and requires brainpower, so be selective.

4. **Have purpose.** Have a reason why you're reading the paper, it'll help you stick with it.

5. **Take notes.** This is more about learning than anything else. It's been shown
taking notes while reading improves understanding significantly vs. just reading. I think this is even more true with research papers.

6. **Have fun.** The stuff you're reading is cool, so why not?
