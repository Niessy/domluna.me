Recently, Triplebyte a couple of articles wrote about [who YC companies want](https://data.triplebyte.com/who-y-combinator-companies-want-c1880a08ac88#.jm33irkk9).
They introduced [*9 hypothetical programmers*](https://data.triplebyte.com/a-taxonomy-of-programmers-d0e9d8529808#.zaeji4ke9). These are essentially categories you can group programmers into. The categories were derived from background hundreds of programmers they've interviewed.

* Product Programmer
* Practical Programmer
* Experienced and Rusty Programmer
* Child Prodigy Programmer
* Trail and Error Programmer
* Strong Junior Programmer
* Technical Programmer
* Enterprise Programmer
* Academic Programmer

For the most part you're probably a mix of these and that mix will change over time. Anyway they also made a pretty chart 

![pretty checkmark chart](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*4mUJ0dhms_9EmBGqhpIa1g.png)

The companies are on the y axis, a checkmark means they are interested that *kind* of programmer. If the square is empty it means they're indifferent.

The gist is companies find product programmers to be most desireable, but no 
type is a shoo-in.

So what's a product programmer? (according to Triplebyte)

> Candidate performs well on technical interviews and will have the respect of other engineers. Theyâ€™re not motivated by solving technical problems, however. They want to think about the product, talk to customers and have an input into how product decisions are made.

So naturally this led me to ask myself:

"Am I a product programmer?"

Or put differently.

"Am I motivated by the product rather than technical challenges?"

I thought about and my answer given historical context is if I'm working on a product then yes and if not then no. This is a weird answer so I'll explain.

When I was working on Daredvl I was motivated/excited by the product not technical challenges.

Generally my side projects aren't products. Instead, they're typically either

1. Exploration of a topic I'm interested in / want to know more about
2. Workflow tool to solve some annoyance

So clearly I'm not motivated by a product here, otherwise I would work on the product (duh). But, I don't think I'm motivated by a hard technical problem either. **Sometimes I just do stuff because I think it's interesting**.

This isn't a bad thing but I do think I should take steps to be more product focused. New Years and all.

So what can I do?

1. Think about products more and try to make products even if they're complete shit.

Like anything the best way to become really at something is to do something a lot. This doesn't have to end in a complete result, maybe it'll turn out to be just a paper mockup. Doesn't matter, the point is just do stuff.

2. Change the approach to starting a project.

All to often I would start something just because tech X looks/sounds cool, let's use it for something! I should flip this script and instead have a concrete idea to work on, as well as a solid reasoning WHY I'm working on it (NIHS I'm looking at you). Then, once that step is complete pick the most suitable tech for the task.

This is mainly a safeguard from being a silly donkey.

For example, Rust looks completely awesome but I should have a solid use before investing time in it.
